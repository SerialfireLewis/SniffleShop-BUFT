# Upstream release sources

Last reviewed: **2026-10-26**

SniffleShop: BUFT points to upstream IPA files directly; it does not rehost them. The catalog now tracks 84 distinct apps and 106 downloadable IPA builds, including real rollback versions from the upstream NOOP and VortX feeds. The table below identifies upstream release pages and compatibility caveats. GitHub Actions runs schema validation, regression tests, and a live URL/declared-size audit. Link status is time-dependent; consult the repository's Actions tab for the latest run rather than treating a past audit as a guarantee.

| App | Tracked release | Official upstream | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PokeMMO | build 32920 | https://pokemmo.com/altstore/ | Official iOS AltStore source; minimum iOS 12.0. Requires an account, persistent internet, and legally obtained game files. The developer does not distribute ROMs. |
| EscapeOS | 0.1.8 | https://github.com/pwnapplehat/EscapeOS/releases | Minimum install version iOS 18.0; cross-app container access is supported only on iOS 26.0–26.6.1 and iOS 27.0 beta 4, with LocalDevVPN and a pairing file. Later OS versions are explicitly unsupported. |
| iDevice Toolkit | 2.0.1 | https://github.com/GeoSn0w/iDevice-Toolkit/releases | Minimum iOS 16.0. The developer explicitly says it does not work inside LiveContainer. Built-in tweaks and file manager/IPA injection have different iOS compatibility bounds; last GitHub release is from July 2025. |
| AltStore Classic | 2.3 | https://github.com/altstoreio/AltStore/releases | Minimum iOS 14.0. Official notarized Classic IPA. Alternative to SideStore; requires the AltServer workflow and is not AltStore PAL. |

## Deliberate exclusions and compatibility notes

**PojavLauncher** remains excluded. Its upstream project marks it discontinued, says it does not work on the latest iOS, and directs users to Amethyst instead.

**Jitterbug/Jitterbug Lite** remains excluded. The upstream repository is archived and its latest release is from 2022; StikDebug is the actively maintained JIT tool tracked here.

The older **Flyinghead Flycast v2.5** feed is excluded because its IPA URL is stale. SniffleShop: BUFT instead tracks a separate **Flycast iOS 26** community fork with its own release artifact.

**RewindBox/NeoStation 0.0.8** was removed after its release IPA URL returned 404 during the link audit. It can be reconsidered if the upstream publishes a reachable, stable asset URL.

## Metadata rules

- `bundleIdentifier` must match the actual app identifier and is case-sensitive.
- `versions[0]` is the newest compatible version presented by the source.
- `size` is the IPA size in bytes, preferably from GitHub release asset metadata or the developer's official source.
- Stable releases are preferred when the project has a stable channel; active beta channels are used when that is the project's supported distribution.
- `appPermissions` is included only when trustworthy current entitlement/privacy metadata is available; it is never guessed.
- Icons and screenshots are included only from reliable upstream project locations.
