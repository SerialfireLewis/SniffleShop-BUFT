# SniffleShop: BUFT

**The Buffed edition.** An independently maintained expansion of SniffleShop focused on a larger, better-organized and verifiable catalog for SideStore, AltStore-compatible workflows, and LiveContainer users.

> BUFT starts with the existing 83-app / 105-build catalog and its validation infrastructure, then evolves independently. The source stays compatible; companion guides and automation can grow without pretending every useful tool is an IPA. The catalog is validated in CI, with unit tests for schema regressions and a separate upstream link/size audit.

SniffleShop: BUFT is a SideStore-compatible AltSource for sideloadable iOS software. It tracks a curated set of useful open-source apps, emulators, developer utilities, JIT tools, Linux/terminal software, and other sideloading-friendly projects using official upstream downloads.

## Add SniffleShop: BUFT to SideStore

Paste this source URL into SideStore:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SerialfireLewis/SniffleShop-BUFT/main/source.json
```

In SideStore, open **Sources**, tap **+ / Add Source**, paste the URL, and add **SniffleShop: BUFT**.

You can also use SideStore's source URL scheme:

```text
sidestore://source?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FSerialfireLewis%2FSniffleShop-BUFT%2Fmain%2Fsource.json
```

## Catalog

**83 distinct apps and 105 downloadable IPA builds** are currently tracked. Multiple versions are retained for NOOP and VortX to provide real upstream rollback options rather than fake extra app entries.

Downloads are intentionally limited to official developer GitHub release assets or official project-hosted IPA URLs. SniffleShop: BUFT does not mirror IPAs.

## Source format

SideStore is compatible with AltStore Sources. SniffleShop: BUFT uses current AltSource metadata where useful while retaining SideStore-compatible fields used by existing SideStore sources. It includes source metadata, app categories, bundle IDs, versions, dates, sizes, OS bounds, and reliable screenshots. `appPermissions` is included only where trustworthy current upstream metadata is available; those values are never guessed.

- **StikDebug** requires iOS 17.4 or newer.
- **Amethyst** requires JIT for normal operation.
- **UTM** is the non-SE JIT build and needs JIT for fast emulation.

- **AltStore Classic 2.3** — Open-source sideloading manager. Alternative to SideStore rather than a required companion; requires the AltServer workflow.

Some newer entries require iOS 26 or 27, and some emulators or game runtimes need JIT, user-supplied game files, or compatible source content. Check each entry's version metadata before installing. Modified clients are identified as such in their descriptions; an upstream release link does not imply endorsement by the original service.

## ROM toolkit and LiveContainer companion tools

The AltSource contains installable IPA entries. For tools that are better delivered as browser apps or through the App Store, see the separate [ROM Toolkit guide](ROM_TOOLS.md). It includes a proper 7z extractor, ROM patchers, save converters, checksum/identification tools, and a LiveContainer-focused workflow.

**Quick picks:**
- [7zen](https://get7zen.app/) — native iPhone/iPad archive app for 7z, RAR, ZIP, TAR and other formats; offline and no ads according to its developer. It is an App Store app, not an IPA in this source.
- [rom-weaver](https://rom-weaver.com/apply-patches) — best all-round ROM workflow: works with 7z/ZIP/RAR archives, chains patches, checks hashes, and can create 7z output. Designed for supported mobile browsers; files are processed locally.
- [Rom Patcher JS](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) — patch and create IPS/UPS/APS/BPS/RUP/PPF/xdelta patches, check ROM hashes, and automatically unpack supported patch archives.
- [PatchVault](https://patchvault.app/) — quick IPS/BPS/UPS/xdelta patching and save conversion for common emulator formats.

These companion tools are deliberately documented separately rather than inserted into `source.json`: browser sites and App Store-only apps are not installable IPA assets. That keeps the SideStore source valid and avoids fake download entries.

## Repository layout

```text
source.json                  Source consumed by SideStore/AltStore
README.md                    Installation and catalog documentation
UPSTREAMS.md                 Release provenance and maintenance notes
scripts/validate_source.py   Current AltSource/SideStore metadata validator
scripts/check_links.py       External icon/screenshot/IPA reachability checker
scripts/catalog_report.py    Catalog category, OS metadata, and age report
.github/workflows/validate.yml
                             CI validation + link checks on updates and weekly
```

## Validate locally

No third-party Python packages are required.

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_source.py source.json
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'
python3 scripts/check_links.py source.json
```

The validator checks required metadata, categories, URL/date syntax, version ordering, bundle-ID uniqueness, byte sizes, screenshots, `appPermissions`, SideStore permission values, and featured-app references. The link checker performs lightweight HTTP checks without intentionally downloading full IPA files.

## Updating an app

1. Check the official upstream in [UPSTREAMS.md](UPSTREAMS.md).
2. Confirm the exact IPA asset, case-sensitive bundle identifier, release date, byte size, and OS requirement.
3. Add the release at the front of the app's `versions` array.
4. Copy security-sensitive `appPermissions` only from trustworthy current upstream metadata or verified IPA metadata.
5. Run both validation scripts and commit.

## Source policy

SniffleShop: BUFT favors official developer GitHub releases, official developer-hosted source feeds, open-source projects, and current sideloadable/non-jailbroken builds. It avoids random IPA mirrors, piracy repositories, placeholder metadata, jailbreak-only/TrollStore-only packages presented as ordinary SideStore builds, and releases known to be incompatible without a clear compatibility bound.

## Compatibility and modified apps

Some entries are legacy utilities or only work on specific iOS releases. **BHTwitter and Apollo (Patched) are modified third-party builds, not official releases from the original app developers.** Cowabunga and Misaka are OS-version-dependent customization tools. Read each entry's upstream release notes before installing; the catalog does not imply every app works on every iOS version.
